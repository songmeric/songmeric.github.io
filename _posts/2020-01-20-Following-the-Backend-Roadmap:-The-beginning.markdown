**<span style="font-size:larger;">I</span>** always envisioned myself of becoming a full stack dev, yet I never had a chance to really sit down, and focus on studying what needed to be learnt to become one. Meanwhile, I came across this website: [roadmap.sh](http://roadmap.sh) that provides a curriculum-like style roadmap for building the fundamental skillsets to become an engineer in various fields such as Frontend, Backend, etc.

Thus, from today I decided to follow the [Backend-Engineer roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/backend) from ground zero, and aim to finish learning everything on this list, and everything on the website in the upcoming months. Of course, I will be doing college work/Leetcoding/Projects on the side as well.

So, welcome aboard on my journey to becoming a Full Stack Dev!

Hopefully you guys take a good advantage of this series of posts for your own sake of career development.

Good luck to you all!
