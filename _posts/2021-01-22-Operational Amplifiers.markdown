<h1>ADC Lecture 9 - Operational Amplifiers</h1>

An op-amp is a circuit with two inputs and one output. 

It is a **differential** amplifier, which means that the output voltage is 

**proportional** to the **difference between the input voltages**:

 {% raw %}
	Y = A(V_{+} - V_{-})
 {% endraw %}

The gain, *A* is usually very large at low frequencies: e.g. *A = 10^5* 

The input currents are very small: e.g. +- 1 nA.

Internally it is a complicated circuit with, but we can forget about that for now, and treat it as an **almost perfect dependent voltage source.**
